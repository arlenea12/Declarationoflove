					<h2>THE TRUTH</h2>
					<p>My love</p>
					<p> You are one of the most important people in my life. I hold you so high and I know that I really suck at making you feel it. You are by far the most amazing
					person to have ever come into my life. I want to wake up every day to see your beautiful face. I want to wake up and make your coffee while you shower, start your car up, get your breakfast ready all before I kiss you and tell you to have a good day.
					I have pictured it all with you. All with a smile on my face. I am not going to lie and say I can't live without you. I have lived without you and 
					there is nothing I regret more than all of the time that I have wasted not being with you. I have never been so sure about someone in my life!</p>

					<h2>OUR FIRST DATE WITH MY FRIEND</h2>
					<p>Our first date with Karla. </p>
					<p>
						I remember that you were stressing about what to wear. You looked so good. You always do. I remember how nervous you were meeting Karla.
						I remember how I held your hand under the table. I remember how we both experienced Cheesecake factory together for the first time.
						I want nights like those. I want to meet the people that you love and I want you to meet the people that I love. I want you to be part of my family.
						I want to make a family with you. I am not getting any younger to be so stupid and let go of the love of my life. You remind me of how many times that I have failed you,
						but I love you with every inch of my heart. I may not be the best at expressing it and it might be harder for me to think vs react, but I know I love you.
						I want more dates in person with you. I want to fly out and kiss your face off. I want to hug you so tight and thank you for being in my life and the impact you have had.
						I want you to come here and show you some of my new favorite places. I want us.
						I love you, Marlee Maillet. I love every single thing about you. I love when I can hear your smile through your voice. I love that when you laugh really loud that you let out a little snort. 
						I love that you can pee on the phone with me, I love that you can toot on the phone with me. I love when you ramble about the gym even though half of the time I dont know what you are on about. 
						I love how passionate you are about the things that you love. I love that you are such a family person. I love that you try to honor every day to the fullest because of your brother. 
						I love that you are such a ray of sunshine. I love that the way that you comfort the ones around you when needed. I love that despite all the hardships in your life that you still have managed to 
						overcome them. I love that you are so eagar to accomplish your goals. I love that you are so honest even when I dont want to hear it. I love that you have been the only person in my life to push me
						to be a better person. I love you, as a person. I have never been the type to fall in love with looks, but you have everything. You have the best personality, the looks, the sense of humor,
						the clothing style, the confidence and the grilling skills. You are the full package. You are all I could ever ask for and more. I want you to be the mother of my kids, I want to come home to you every single night
						and be reminded of how lucky I am, I want to see you grill in the summer for our kids, I want to make you dinner, I want to bring home flowers just because I know you love them, I want to clean your car off in the winter,
						I want our kids to see how much we love each other and strive to have that one day. I want to go to our dream destinations together. I want us to cross off things on our bucket lists. I want a life time experience with you.
						I want it all and I want it with you. There is not doubt about it.

					<h2>COMFORT</h2>
					<p>I think about this a lot. Feeling your hair as I ran my fingers through your head. Having you lay on me. This is the comfort that I want for us.
					I want this every chance that I can get it. I want this with our kids. Its so hard to do this with the distance, but I would take this in person over a night out
					or playing video games. This beats everything. I want to have these moments as we talk about our days and we talk about random things. I want to tell you how much I adore you. 
					I want to just have you in my presence so that you can feel my heart beat for you and only you (Our kids too if we have any.) I crave this type of intimacy.
					This would cure any bad day for me. This is what I would look forward to on days where I struggled mentally. This is what I would look forward to even just on a regular day. 
					The thought alone of just coming home. You are my home. You are my comfort. Not just because I am familiar with you, but because I love you. I envision a future with you. I want you in my present and my future. 
					The only place I would not want you in is my past.</p>

			<h2>PAINTED FUTURE</h2>
			<p> I want to come home to some of your meals. I want to kiss you the second I walk in the door. I want to have all of those sweet little romantic feelings with you. 
			I want our kids to run to the door when either of us comes home. I want to cook meals with you on the weekends. I want us to have a healthy home life. By that I mean, I dont want to eat out all the time, I want home cooked meals, I want us
			to take turns making stuff. I want to try new foods with you. I want to have you as dinner. I want to have a fairytale ending how I have always dreamed of. I know that a huge part of why we are broken up is that I 
			forget about that. I react without thinking. Even when I am sad, at the end of the day I want you. Even when I was doubty, I just wanted you. Even when I was insecure, I just wanted to be held by you.
			To me, you are my dream come true. We both have such long journeys in life and I really hope that we have each other in the end. You are my end game.
			You make my little gay heart so happy. I cannot imagine giving my all to someone that is not you. I cannot imagine having a family with someone that is not you. 
			Loving you was not my choice at first and it just happened. However, if you allow me, I do plan on loving you and picking you as my person every single day until I no longer live. The only person that has been holding me back from allowing myself to be happy
			is myself and I will work on that every day because you are worth it. I am so in love with you, Marlee Maillet.
